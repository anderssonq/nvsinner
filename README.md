NvSinner is a Neovim config managed with **lazy.nvim**, packaged as an
installable distro with a native **carbon** theme (a self-contained
oxocarbon / IBM Carbon port — industrial grays, blue-forward accents). It
installs under its own `NVIM_APPNAME=nvsinner`, so it runs side-by-side with
any existing `~/.config/nvim` without touching it.

## ✨ Features

- **AI as a terminal column, not a plugin** — run any CLI agent (`claude`,
  `kiro-cli`, `opencode`, …) in up to 9 persistent vertical columns
  (`<leader>j`, `<leader>j2`…`j9`). The first open shows a picker asking which
  CLI to launch; the CLI handles its own auth, no API key touches the config.
- **Send-to-AI bridge** — pipe editor context straight into the AI column
  without touching the clipboard: `<leader>as` sends the visual selection,
  `<leader>ab` an `@path` mention, `<leader>ad` the current line's
  diagnostics. Text lands in the CLI's input as one editable block — never
  auto-submitted.
- **Ask AI modal** — select code and hit `<leader>x` (or just **double-click
  a word**) for the IDE-style quick-action menu: **Fix / Refactor / Explain /
  Ask custom question**. The chosen prompt (with the file path and line
  range) plus the selection lands in the AI column's input; with more than
  one session open, a picker asks which one.
- **AI edit highlights** — when the agent rewrites an open file, the changed
  lines get a soft wash of your accent color right in the file pane (distinct
  from git's gutter marks) and clear the moment you take the file over.
- **Live agent activity** — every terminal carries a winbar with a session
  label and a native busy/idle spinner (`⠹ working…` / `● idle`), plus an
  opportunistic `◆ needs input` state when the program signals a prompt via
  OSC sequences (shell integration / notifying CLIs). The statusline shows a
  cockpit badge (`AI: 2 working · 1 idle`) across all sessions, and
  `<leader>ja` opens a picker that jumps to any session.
- **Disk-wins auto-reload** — when the agent edits a file, the open buffer
  reloads automatically and a `🤖 AI · edited <file>` toast names it.
- **Prompt library** — `<leader>p` opens a modal of eleven reusable AI
  prompts (plain JSON, hand-editable) and copies your pick to the OS
  clipboard.
- **Mason-style modals** — `:NvSinnerMenu` (settings, persisted),
  `:NvSinnerPrompts`, and `:NvSinnerHelp` (a command palette that runs what
  you pick), all keyboard- and mouse-driven.
- **Carbon theme, configurable in one place** — dark/light variants,
  transparency, four accent packs, and per-role color slots, all from a
  single palette file (`lua/core/carbon.lua`) — live-applied and persisted.
- **Native-first** — focus glow, mouse-hover docs, agent activity, the
  send-to-AI bridge, health checks, and the updater are zero-dependency core
  modules, not plugins.
- **Distro table stakes** — Trouble diagnostics panel (`<leader>x*`), LSP
  rename (`<leader>rn`) alongside the Neovim 0.11 builtins, Telescope pickers
  for diagnostics/keymaps/commands/resume (`<leader>s*`), which-key group
  labels, and LSP servers for TypeScript, Lua, HTML/CSS/JSON/YAML, Python and
  Bash out of the box (Go/Rust/Ruby light up when their toolchains exist).
- **Fast** — almost everything is lazy-loaded; headless cold start ≈ 40 ms
  (median of 3, measured 2026-07-03). Check yours with `:Lazy profile`.
- **Reproducible** — plugins are pinned in a committed `lazy-lock.json`;
  installs and updates `restore` to the tested set instead of floating to
  latest. A plenary test suite covers the core behavior (`make test`).

## 📦 Requirements

| Tool | Used by |
|------|---------|
| Neovim **0.11+** | native `vim.lsp` API, `vim.uv` |
| `git` | lazy.nvim plugin fetch |
| `ripgrep` | Telescope live grep |
| `node` | `prettier` / `eslint_d` |
| A **Nerd Font** | icons (FiraCode Nerd Font is bundled in `fonts/`) |
| `eslint_d`, `prettier`, `stylua`, `shfmt` | none-ls formatting/linting (auto-installed via Mason on first boot) |
| an AI CLI, e.g. `claude` | AI terminal column (optional) |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Neovim **0.11+** is a hard requirement — the config uses `vim.uv` and the
> native `vim.lsp.config` / `vim.lsp.enable` API and will not load on older
> versions. Verify with `nvim --version | head -1`.

The AI workflow is just a CLI agent run in the terminal column — install one
(e.g. `npm i -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code`) and run it once to log in. No
`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` needed by the config; the CLI handles its own auth.

## 🚀 Getting started

### One-liner

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anderssonq/nvsinner/main/install.sh | bash
```

Clones NvSinner into `~/.config/nvsinner`, installs a `nvsinner` launcher into
`~/.local/bin`, and bootstraps every plugin. Then just run:

```bash
nvsinner
```

### Manual

```bash
git clone https://github.com/anderssonq/nvsinner.git ~/.config/nvsinner
NVIM_APPNAME=nvsinner nvim     # lazy.nvim bootstraps + installs on first launch
```

> [!NOTE]
> `NVIM_APPNAME=nvsinner` gives the distro its own config/data/state/cache
> dirs, so it never collides with another Neovim setup — your existing
> `~/.config/nvim` is untouched.

LSP servers (`lua_ls`, `ts_ls`, `html`, `pyright`, `bashls`, `jsonls`,
`yamlls`, `cssls`) and the formatting/linting tools (`stylua`, `prettier`,
`eslint_d`, `shfmt`) auto-install via Mason on first launch — no
manual `:MasonInstall` or `npm i -g` needed. On the first interactive launch a
one-time toast points at `:checkhealth nvsinner` if any external tool is
missing. Verify anytime with `:Lazy` and `:checkhealth`.

## 🤖 The AI workflow

There are no in-editor AI plugins. AI is a **CLI agent run in the terminal
column**: press `<leader>j` to open it. The first time a session opens, a
picker appears in the column's own space asking which CLI to launch —
`claude`, `kiro-cli`, `opencode` (uninstalled ones are marked), or **plain
terminal — no AI**, which starts your shell and titles the column `term` like
the horizontal terminals. Navigate with `j`/`k`, launch with `Enter` (or
click a row), cancel with `q`. Sessions 2–9 (`<leader>j2`…`<leader>j9`) are
independent columns, each with its own agent. The column's side (left/right)
is configurable in `:NvSinnerMenu`.

Every terminal's top bar shows a **session label and activity spinner**
(`AI · 1 ⠹ working…` / `● idle`) driven by actual output, so a glance tells
you whether an agent — or a long build in a `<leader>t` terminal — is still
going. When the program signals a prompt (OSC 133 shell integration, or a
terminal notification), the bar flips to `◆ needs input` — this only works
for programs that emit those sequences; the output-based spinner covers
everything else. The statusline adds a cockpit badge (`AI: 2 working ·
1 idle`) summarizing every session, and `<leader>ja` opens a picker that
jumps to (or reopens) any of them.

**Send context without the clipboard:** select code and hit `<leader>as` to
drop it into the AI column's input, `<leader>ab` to send an `@path` mention
of the current file, `<leader>ad` to send the current line's diagnostics.
Multi-line text arrives as one editable block (bracketed paste) and is never
auto-submitted — you review and press Enter. With no session open yet, the
bridge opens session 1 and asks you to resend.

**Ask AI about a selection:** select code and hit `<leader>x` to open the
Ask-AI modal — **Fix**, **Refactor**, **Explain**, or **Ask custom question**
(typed in a small input). The action becomes a prompt header carrying the
file's path and line range (`Fix this code in lua/core/foo.lua:10-25:`),
followed by the selected code, and lands in the AI column's input like every
other bridge send. With more than one AI session registered, a picker asks
which session to send to. `:NvSinnerAskAI` reruns it on the last selection,
and **double-clicking a word** in a code pane opens the same modal over that
word (an active visual selection is used instead when there is one; special
panes like the tree and terminals are left alone).

> [!WARNING]
> Auto-reload is **disk-wins** by design: when the AI CLI edits a file on
> disk, the buffer reloads and unsaved in-editor edits to that buffer are
> discarded. It's built for the viewer-style workflow — you edit through the
> AI pane, the editor is the cockpit. Each reload fires a `🤖 AI · edited
> <file>` toast so nothing changes silently.

After each reload, the lines the agent changed get a **soft background wash
in your accent color** (the one picked in `:NvSinnerMenu`, blended into the
editor background like a tinted cursor-line so the code stays readable) right
in the file pane — you see at a glance what the AI just touched while you're
still reading its summary in the column. The marks clear as soon as you take
over the file — move the cursor in it or start editing. For a persistent,
reviewable diff use `<leader>gd` (Diffview) as usual.

### `:NvSinnerPrompts` — the prompt library

Press `<leader>p` (or run `:NvSinnerPrompts`) to open a floating library of
reusable AI prompts — eleven ship as defaults: PR description, strict code
review, feature plan, bug fix, tests-from-pattern, commit message, refactor,
explain code, docstrings, security review, and git conflict resolution.
Picking one **copies the full prompt to the OS clipboard**, ready to paste
into the AI column's CLI (then fill in the `[PLACEHOLDERS]`). Digits `1`–`9`
jump to the first nine; reach the rest with `j`/`k` or the mouse.

> [!TIP]
> The library is plain JSON at `settings/prompts.json`: press `e` inside the
> modal to open it and add or edit prompts (`content` can be a string or an
> array of lines; the file is re-read on every open, so no restart needed).

### `:NvSinnerHelp` — the command palette

Can't remember a command? `:NvSinnerHelp` lists every NvSinner command
(`:NvSinnerMenu`, `:NvSinnerPrompts`, `:NvSinnerUpdate`, `:NvSinnerSync`,
`:checkhealth nvsinner`, …) with a one-line description. Press `Enter` — or
click a row — to **run it**; the palette closes itself. New commands are
discovered automatically, so the list is never stale.

## 🎨 Settings & theming

### `:NvSinnerMenu` — the settings modal

The easiest way to configure the theme (and a few layout choices) is
**`:NvSinnerMenu`**: a Mason-style floating panel where every change applies
live and persists across restarts (stored as JSON in the distro's `settings/`
folder). Navigate with `j`/`k`, change a value with `h`/`l` (or
`Enter`/`Space`), jump with `1`–`9`, close with `q` — or use the mouse:
hovering moves the selection and a click cycles the row's value.

| Row | Values |
|-----|--------|
| Background theme | `carbon` (dark, default) / `moon` (light) / `onedusk` / `mocha` / `kyoto` / `fjord` / `monolith` — original palettes inspired by One Dark Pro, Catppuccin Mocha, Tokyo Night, Nord and Monokai |
| Transparency | `off` / `on` |
| Accent | `blue` / `magenta` / `green` / `purple` — swaps only the identity text accent, never the gray surfaces |
| Folder color | `accent` / `teal` / `aqua` / `pink` / `green` / `purple` / `gray` — recolors Neo-tree's folder names + icons |
| Notif color | `default` / `accent` / `teal` / `aqua` / `magenta` / `pink` / `green` / `purple` / `plain` — recolors info toasts (warnings/errors keep their semantic colors) |
| Variables | same choices — recolors syntax variables, parameters and fields |
| Strings | same choices — recolors syntax strings |
| Functions | same choices — paints the whole function/method family in one accent |
| Neo-tree side | `left` / `right` |
| AI column side | `left` / `right` |
| Notifications | `shown` / `hidden` (hides info toasts; warnings/errors still show) |

### Theme options (carbon)

The theme flags can also be set per launch via an environment variable, or
with a `vim.g` global early in `lua/core/options.lua`. Precedence: `vim.g`
wins over the environment, which wins over the persisted `:NvSinnerMenu`
value:

| Flag | Values | Per launch | Persistent |
|------|--------|-----------|------------|
| Background theme | `carbon` (default) / `moon` / `onedusk` / `mocha` / `kyoto` / `fjord` / `monolith` | `NVSINNER_THEME=fjord nvsinner` | `vim.g.nvsinner_theme = "fjord"` |
| Transparency | off (default) / on | `NVSINNER_TRANSPARENT=1 nvsinner` | `vim.g.nvsinner_transparent = true` |
| Accent pack | `blue` (default) / `magenta` / `green` / `purple` | `NVSINNER_ACCENT=green nvsinner` | `vim.g.nvsinner_accent = "green"` |
| Folder color | `accent` (default) / `teal` / `aqua` / `pink` / `green` / `purple` / `gray` | `NVSINNER_FOLDER=aqua nvsinner` | `vim.g.nvsinner_folder = "aqua"` |
| Notif color | `default` / `accent` / `teal` / `aqua` / `magenta` / `pink` / `green` / `purple` / `plain` | `NVSINNER_NOTIF=pink nvsinner` | `vim.g.nvsinner_notif = "pink"` |
| Variables color | same choices as Notif color | `NVSINNER_VARIABLES=aqua nvsinner` | `vim.g.nvsinner_variables = "aqua"` |
| Strings color | same choices as Notif color | `NVSINNER_STRINGS=green nvsinner` | `vim.g.nvsinner_strings = "green"` |
| Functions color | same choices as Notif color | `NVSINNER_FUNCTIONS=purple nvsinner` | `vim.g.nvsinner_functions = "purple"` |

Transparent mode drops every full-surface background (editor, floats, side
panels) so your terminal's own background/blur shows through; small solid
elements (the statusline mode chip, the AI busy chip, the terminal focus bar)
keep their color so the UI stays legible.

<details>
<summary>Migrating from the glass theme (kanagawa-dragon)</summary>

Nothing is required for a stock install — `:NvSinnerUpdate` (or `git pull`
followed by `nvim --headless "+Lazy! restore" +qa`) picks up the carbon theme
automatically, since the colorscheme ships inside this repo. Two optional
cleanups if you customized things:

- **Leftover plugin:** kanagawa.nvim is no longer in the plugin set; run
  `:Lazy clean` once to delete it from disk.
- **Personal highlight tweaks:** anything referencing the old glass hexes
  (`#0a0a0f`, `#111118`, `#c4746e`, …) should switch to palette roles —
  `local c = require("core.carbon").colors()` and use `c.base00`, `c.base09`,
  etc. (the full role table and design notes live in `lua/core/carbon.lua`).
  Rough mapping: bg `#0a0a0f` → `base00`, glass `#111118` → `blend`, FG
  `#c5c9d5` → `base04`, muted `#7a7f8d` → `base03`, accent `#c4746e` →
  `base09` (identity) or `base10` (attention).

### NvSinner commands (`<leader>x*` shortcuts)

Normal-mode `<leader>x` is shared with Trouble (`xx`/`xX`/`xs`/`xl`/`xq`
above); these letters deliberately avoid those. Visual `<leader>x` stays the
Ask-AI modal.

|------|------|--------|
| `<leader>xm` | n | `:NvSinnerMenu` — settings modal |
| `<leader>xh` | n | `:NvSinnerHelp` — command palette |
| `<leader>xp` | n | `:NvSinnerPrompts` — prompt library (same as `<leader>p`) |
| `<leader>xo` | n | `:NvSinnerSymbols` — document symbols modal (same as `<leader>cs`; `xo` = outline, Trouble owns `xs`) |
| `<leader>xu` | n | `:NvSinnerUpdate` — update to the pinned plugin set |
| `<leader>xS` | n | `:NvSinnerSync` — float plugins to latest (**rewrites `lazy-lock.json`**; capital on purpose) |
| `<leader>xc` | n | `:checkhealth nvsinner` — external-tools health check |

### Git

| Keys | Mode | Action |
|------|------|--------|
| `]h` / `[h` | n | Next / previous changed hunk |

| `<leader>gd` | n | Diffview: working tree vs index |
| `<leader>gh` / `<leader>gH` | n | Diffview: current-file / whole-repo history |
| `<leader>gq` | n | Diffview: close |

### Sessions, folds, windows & misc

| Keys | Mode | Action |

## ⚡ Performance notes

Plugins are lazy-loaded via lazy.nvim triggers:

- `event = "InsertEnter"` — completion (`nvim-cmp`), autopairs.
- `event = { "BufReadPost", "BufNewFile" }` — treesitter, LSP, breadcrumbs.
- `event = { "BufReadPre", "BufNewFile" }` — gitsigns (sign-column markers).
- `event = "VeryLazy"` — statusline, scroll, notifications, surround,
  which-key.
- `cmd` / `keys` — Telescope, Neo-tree, toggleterm AI column, diffview.

Only the colorscheme (`theme.lua`) and start screen (`dashboard.lua`) load
eagerly. Check the breakdown anytime with `:Lazy profile`.

## 🔄 Updating

NvSinner is just a git clone, so an update is a `git pull` plus a plugin
restore. Pick whichever you like:

- **In-editor (recommended):** run `:NvSinnerUpdate`. It `git pull`s the
  config, restores plugins to the pinned `lazy-lock.json`, and runs
  `:checkhealth`. **Restart Neovim afterwards** so the new Lua config loads.
- **Re-run the installer:** the one-liner is idempotent — on an existing
  clone it `git pull`s and re-installs plugins instead of skipping.
- **By hand:**

  ```bash
  git -C ~/.config/nvsinner pull
  NVIM_APPNAME=nvsinner nvim --headless "+Lazy! restore" +qa
  ```

Plugins are pinned in the committed `lazy-lock.json` and updates use
`Lazy! restore` (not `sync`), so you get the exact plugin versions the distro
was tested with.

> [!WARNING]
> To deliberately float every plugin to its latest commit instead, run
> **`:NvSinnerSync`** — it runs `:Lazy sync` (which **rewrites
> `lazy-lock.json`**) and then updates any outdated Mason packages. This
> leaves the tested, pinned plugin set: retest afterwards, and commit the new
> lockfile if you maintain your own clone. If a plugin **changes branch**
> during the sync (an upstream default-branch flip usually means a rewrite),
> a warning names it and gives the rollback recipe:
> `git restore lazy-lock.json` + `:Lazy restore`.

## 🩺 Health check

Missing external tools (ripgrep, node, stylua, prettier, eslint_d, a Nerd
Font) make features silently no-op rather than error. To see what's present
at a glance:

```vim
:checkhealth nvsinner
```

It lists each external with an install hint for anything missing. On the
**first interactive launch** NvSinner also pops a one-time toast if
something's missing, pointing you here — it never nags again.

## 🧹 Uninstalling

NvSinner keeps everything under its own `nvsinner` app name, so removing it
never touches your other `~/.config/nvim`. Run the uninstaller (prompts for
confirmation from a terminal; pass `--yes` when piping):

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anderssonq/nvsinner/main/uninstall.sh | bash -s -- --yes
# or, from a clone:  ./uninstall.sh
```

It removes the four `nvsinner` dirs — config (`~/.config/nvsinner`), data
(`~/.local/share/nvsinner`), state (`~/.local/state/nvsinner`), cache
(`~/.cache/nvsinner`) — and the `~/.local/bin/nvsinner` launcher. If your
config dir is a symlink (e.g. a dev checkout), only the link is removed; the
target is left intact. Or remove those five paths by hand.
